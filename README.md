# FITSWEBQL SE

## A BLAST FROM THE PAST
An experimental Fortran 2018 FITSWebQL built with Co-Array Fortran & MPI, using NASA's FITSIO to read FITS files. FITSWEBQL SE scales across multiple computers (cluster nodes).

Co-Array Fortran has since been replaced by Julia since it (Fortran 2018) lacks concurrent (asynchronous) Co-Arrays. Out of all programming languages, Julia has the best distributed computing capabilities.

## BACK TO THE FUTURE
FITSWEBQLSE (Supercomputer Edition) coded in Julia. Originally Julia was positioned as a better (faster) Python alternative but to me it seems more like "FORTRAN ON STEROIDS". Julia's handling of array and vector data types resembles FORTRAN.
