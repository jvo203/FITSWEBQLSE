# FITSWEBQL SE

## *OLD*
An experimental Fortran 2018 FITSWebQL built with Co-Array Fortran & MPI, using NASA's FITSIO to read FITS files. FITSWEBQL SE scales across multiple computers (cluster nodes).

Co-Array Fortran has been replaced by Julia since it lacks concurrent (asynchronous) Co-Arrays. Out of all programming languages, Julia has the best distributed computing capabilities.

## *NEW*
FITSWEBQLSE (Supercomputer Edition) coded in Julia.
